# Healthcare Management System (SQL Project)

This project is a relational database system designed to manage patients, doctors, appointments, medical procedures, and billing data in a healthcare environment. Built entirely using SQL, it features a normalized schema, real-world query examples, and testable data flows that simulate hospital operations.

Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anouskaabhisikta/healthcare-management-system

## Project Structure

- `schema.sql`: SQL DDL file to create all database tables
- `queries.sql`: Practical queries for reporting, analytics, and tracking
- `insert_data.sql`: Insert sample/mock data here

## Tools Used

- PostgreSQL (recommended)
- DBeaver or pgAdmin (for SQL execution & ERD)
- Python (optional, for CSV preprocessing)
- dbdiagram.io or drawSQL (for ER diagram)

---

## How to Use

1. Load `schema.sql` into your SQL environment to create the tables.
2. (Optional) Use `insert_data.sql` to load test data.
3. Run `queries.sql` to see sample insights and reports.

## Future Improvements

- Add user authentication (admin vs. patient)
- Include lab results & medications tables
- Build a dashboard using Python (Streamlit or Flask)
